# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior with Undefined Parent Width

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the CSS `calc()` function. When using percentages and lengths within `calc()`, unexpected behavior can occur if the parent element's width is not explicitly defined.

## Problem
The provided CSS code attempts to set an element's width to 50% of its parent's width minus 10 pixels. If the parent's width is not set, the calculation might fail or produce inconsistent results. This leads to layout issues and unexpected rendering.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly setting the parent's width, ensuring that the calculation in `calc()` always has defined values to work with. This provides consistent and predictable results.
