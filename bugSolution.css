The solution is to ensure that the parent container has a defined width, either explicitly through a width property or implicitly through its content:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* or any other fixed or percentage value */
}

.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

By providing a defined width for the parent element, the `calc()` function now has a valid value to compute the `50%` from, ensuring that the calculation is performed correctly and the container's width is reliably set.
